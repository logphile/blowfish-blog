  Hey! My name is <strong>Phil Boyce</strong> and <a href="https://www.logphile.com" style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">logPhile</a> is my blog. is my blog.
</span>

At 14, one of my older friends introduced me to [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon). I begged my parents the entire school year and they finally bought me a computer. My friends and I mowed lawns that summer. They saved up for SNES games. I saved up for a 28.8 Kbs modem. Computers became my life.

I've spent 20 years as a Sys Admin "jack of all trades" and exposed to all kinds of tech. Then I had a kid and have been a stay-at-home dad for a few years. Being a father to a little girl I became a different kind of "jack of all trades". Now that she is older I am looking to reenter the industry.

**logPhile** is a collection of things I am working on, learning, and a way to track my progress and share my thoughts.
