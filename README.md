# 💻 Logphile: Azure Cloud Blog for the Curious and Technical

This is the repository for my blog, [logPhile](https:/logphile.com). It's where I share what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and where my technical focus is right now. Think of it as a working portfolio.

## 📘 About This Project

This repo powers [logPhile.com](https://logphile.com) (built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme). Contains long-form posts tied directly to the [AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-104/) certification — but written with practical (hopefully), real-world relevance in mind.

Each post is aligned to a **Skills Measured** objective, but avoids GUI walkthroughs in favor of:

- PowerShell + Microsoft Graph
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Auditability, scalability, automation
- Real engineering stories, edge cases, and “why it matters”

---

## 🧱 Stack

- ⚡ **Hugo** (static site generator)
- 🎨 **Blowfish** theme (customized for a dark/cyberpunk aesthetic)
- 📄 **Markdown** for content
- 🔌 **Microsoft Graph**, PowerShell, Terraform (as used in posts)

## ✍️ Author Goals

This project exists to:

1. Reinforce my own Azure learning through deep work.
2. Show employers that I'm active, technical, and forward-thinking.
3. Replace “hello world” demos with opinionated, reusable examples.
4. Keep my skills sharp — scripting, automation, and problem-solving.
