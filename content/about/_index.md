  Hey! My name is <strong>Phil Boyce</strong> and <a href="https://www.logphile.com" style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">logPhile</a> is my blog.
</span>

At 14, one of my older friends introduced me to [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon). I begged my parents the entire school year and they finally bought me a computer. My friends and I mowed lawns that summer. They saved up for SNES games. I saved up for a 28.8 Kbs modem. Computers became my life.

I've spent 20 years as a Sys Admin "jack of all trades" and exposed to all kinds of tech. Then I had a kid and have been a stay-at-home dad for a few years. Being a father to a little girl I became a different kind of "jack of all trades". Now that she is older I am looking to reenter the industry.

This blog is a collection of things I am working on, learning, and a way to track my progress and share my thoughts.

  Hey, I’m <strong>Phil Boyce</strong>, and <a href="https://www.logphile.com" style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">logPhile</a> is my space to learn out loud.

I got into computers the old-school way—through [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon), BBSes, curiosity, and a dial-up connection that became my one and only ask. While my friends were saving up for SNES cartridges, I was saving lawn-mowing money for a 28.8k modem. And I never really stopped.

I’ve spent two decades as a sysadmin—one of those “jack of all trades” types. I’ve worked across stacks, solved problems nobody could reproduce, and kept things running quietly behind the scenes. Then I hit pause to raise a little girl, and that came with its own version of uptime monitoring, triage, and soft skills.

Now that she’s older, I’m ready to step back into the field—with fresh perspective, sharpened skills, and the same curiosity that got me into tech in the first place.

**logPhile** is where I document what I’m building, learning, and exploring. Sometimes it’s cloud infrastructure. Sometimes it’s a weird little side project. Mostly it’s a way to stay honest, stay sharp, and keep moving forward.

Thanks for stopping by.
