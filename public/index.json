My name is Phil Boyce and logPhile is my blog.\rAt 14, one of my older friends introduced me to MUDs. I begged my parents the entire school year and they finally bought me a computer.

While my friends were saving up for SNES cartridges, I was saving lawn-mowing money for a 28.8k modem. And I never really stopped.\nI‚Äôve spent two decades as a sysadmin‚Äîone of those ‚Äújack of all trades‚Äù types. I‚Äôve worked across stacks, solved problems nobody could reproduce, and kept things running quietly behind the scenes. Then I hit pause to raise a little girl, and that came with its own version of uptime monitoring, triage, and soft skills.\nNow that she‚Äôs older, I‚Äôm ready to step back into the field‚Äîwith fresh perspective, sharpened skills, and the same curiosity that got me into tech in the first place.\nlogPhile is where I document what I‚Äôm building, learning, and exploring. Sometimes it‚Äôs cloud infrastructure. Sometimes it‚Äôs a weird little side project. Mostly it‚Äôs a way to stay honest, stay sharp, and keep moving forward.\nThanks for stopping by.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"About Me","summary":"\u003chr\u003e\r\n\u003cspan style=\"color: white;\"\u003e\r\n  Hey!
