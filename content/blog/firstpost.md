## 2. AI and Automation in the Cloud
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are integrating deeply with cloud services, enabling automation, predictive analytics, and smarter applications.

## 3. Serverless Computing
Serverless is eliminating infrastructure management, making it easier for developers to deploy applications without worrying about server maintenance.

## 4. Security and Compliance Enhancements
As cloud adoption grows, so does the need for better security. Expect advancements in encryption, zero-trust architectures, and stricter compliance regulations.

## Final Thoughts
Cloud computing is an ever-evolving landscape. Staying ahead of these trends will be key for businesses and developers alike.
