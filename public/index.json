That‚Äôs where Microsoft Graph comes in. In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through how to create Microsoft Entra ID users using PowerShell and Microsoft Graph‚Äîwith clean, scalable scripting.\nüï∞Ô∏è A (Very) Brief History of Microsoft Graph #\rIntroduced in 2015, Microsoft Graph unified dozens of fragmented Microsoft APIs‚ÄîAzure AD, Exchange, SharePoint, Teams‚Äîinto a single, modern endpoint. It\u0026rsquo;s now the backbone of identity and data access across Microsoft 365 and Azure services. Microsoft is phasing out older modules like AzureAD and MSOnline in favor of Graph, making it the go-to tool for cloud-native management and automation.\nüí° Smarter Entra ID User Creation with PowerShell + Graph #\rHere‚Äôs how to automate Entra ID user creation using PowerShell and Microsoft Graph‚Äîwith smart defaults, error handling, and dynamic group assignment. Creating users through the Azure Portal works\u0026hellip; until it doesn‚Äôt. Once you‚Äôre dealing with onboarding, consistency, or dynamic environments, it‚Äôs time to automate.\n‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites #\rBefore we start scripting, make sure you have:\nPowerShell 7+ Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK Admin permissions to Microsoft Entra ID Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser Authenticate:\nConnect-MgGraph -Scopes \u0026#34;User.ReadWrite.All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Group.ReadWrite.All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Directory.Read.All\u0026#34; You\u0026rsquo;ll get a consent prompt to grant permission the first time.\rüõ†Ô∏è Define the User Creation Function #\rHere‚Äôs a reusable PowerShell function that creates a user and adds them to a security group.\nfunction New-SmartUser { param( [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]$DisplayName, [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]$UserPrincipalName, [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]$Password, [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]$Department, [Parameter()] [string]$GroupName = \u0026#34;Default Users\u0026#34; ) # Create the user $user = New-MgUser -AccountEnabled:$true ` -DisplayName $DisplayName ` -MailNickname ($UserPrincipalName.Split(\u0026#34;@\u0026#34;)[0]) ` -PasswordProfile @{ ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = $true; Password = $Password } ` -UserPrincipalName $UserPrincipalName ` -Department $Department ` -UsageLocation \u0026#34;US\u0026#34; Write-Host \u0026#34;User \u0026#39;$($user.DisplayName)\u0026#39; created successfully.\u0026#34; # Find or create the group $group = Get-MgGroup -Filter \u0026#34;displayName eq \u0026#39;$GroupName\u0026#39;\u0026#34; -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue if (-not $group) { $group = New-MgGroup -DisplayName $GroupName ` -MailEnabled:$false -MailNickname:$GroupName.Replace(\u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) ` -SecurityEnabled:$true -GroupTypes @() Write-Host \u0026#34;Group \u0026#39;$GroupName\u0026#39; created.\u0026#34; } # Add user to group New-MgGroupMember -GroupId $group.Id -DirectoryObjectId $user.Id Write-Host \u0026#34;User added to group \u0026#39;$GroupName\u0026#39;.\u0026#34; } ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs Create a User #\rNew-SmartUser -DisplayName \u0026#34;Beast\u0026#34; ` -UserPrincipalName \u0026#34;hank.mccoy@logphile.com\u0026#34; ` -Password \u0026#34;l1n3arFus1on\u0026#34; ` -Department \u0026#34;R\u0026amp;D\u0026#34; ` -GroupName \u0026#34;Research \u0026amp; Development\u0026#34; \u0026#x1f4dc; The Results #\rC:\\Users\\beast\u0026gt; New-SmartUser -DisplayName \u0026#34;Beast\u0026#34; ` \u0026gt;\u0026gt; -UserPrincipalName \u0026#34;hank.mccoy@logphile.com\u0026#34; ` \u0026gt;\u0026gt; -Password \u0026#34;P@ssword123!\u0026#34; ` \u0026gt;\u0026gt; -Department \u0026#34;R\u0026amp;D\u0026#34; ` \u0026gt;\u0026gt; -GroupName \u0026#34;Research \u0026amp; Development\u0026#34; User \u0026#39;Beast\u0026#39; created successfully.

Reasons to change:\n‚úÖ Modern + Supported: Microsoft Graph is the future; older modules are deprecated. ‚úÖ Scriptable + Auditable: Build repeatable workflows and keep them in source control. ‚úÖ Richer Control: Set attributes, assign groups, and handle edge cases the portal hides. ‚úÖ Cross-Tenant Ready: Run the same script across multiple environments without clicking around. ‚úÖ Least Privilege: Use fine-grained Graph scopes instead of over-privileged admin accounts. ‚úÖ Error Handling: Catch issues like duplicate UPNs or missing license capacity in real-time. üìä Comparison: Portal vs Legacy PowerShell vs Graph + PowerShell #\rFeature Portal Old PowerShell (AzureAD) Graph + PowerShell Automation-ready ‚ùå ‚úÖ ‚úÖ‚úÖ Modern, supported ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated ‚úÖ‚úÖ Full attribute support ‚ùå ‚ùå ‚úÖ‚úÖ API-level consistency ‚ùå ‚ùå ‚úÖ‚úÖ Fine-grained permissions ‚ùå ‚ùå ‚úÖ‚úÖ Auditable/source-controllable ‚ùå ‚úÖ ‚úÖ‚úÖ Scalable across tenants ‚ùå ‚úÖ ‚úÖ‚úÖ üìé Resources #\rMicrosoft Graph PowerShell SDK Docs\nUser Object Docs\nGraph Permissions Guide\n","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/ditch-the-portal-create-entra-users-with-powershell-plus-graph/","section":"","summary":"Ditch the portal and script like a pro‚Äîthis post shows you how to create Entra ID users with PowerShell and Microsoft Graph for smarter, faster, mistake-free identity management.","title":"Ditch the Portal: Create Entra Users with PowerShell + Graph","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/entra/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Entra","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"logPhile","summary":"","title":"logPhile","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/microsoft-graph/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Microsoft Graph","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/powershell/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Powershell","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"March 18, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" I got into computers the old-school way‚Äîthrough MUDs, BBSes, curiosity, and a dial-up connection.
