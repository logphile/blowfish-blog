  Hey, I’m <strong>Phil Boyce</strong>, and <a href="https://www.logphile.com" style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">logPhile</a> is my space to learn out loud.
</span>

I got into computers the old-school way—through [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon), BBSes, curiosity, and a dial-up connection. This became my one and only ask. While my friends were saving up for SNES cartridges, I was saving lawn-mowing money for a 28.8k modem. And I never really stopped.

I’ve spent two decades as a sysadmin—one of those “jack of all trades” types. I’ve worked across stacks, made broken things work again, and kept things running quietly behind the scenes. Then I hit pause to focus on something even more important--my daughter. That came with its own version of uptime monitoring, triage, and soft skills.

Now that she’s older, I’m ready to step back into the field—-with fresh perspective, sharpened skills, and the same curiosity that got me into tech in the first place.

**logPhile** is where I document what I’m learning, building and exploring. Sometimes it’s cloud infrastructure. Sometimes it’s a weird little side project. Mostly it’s a way to stay honest, stay sharp, and keep moving forward.

Thanks for stopping by.
